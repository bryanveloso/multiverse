Got this gem in my email today.

    Hello,

    I am interested in purchasing your domain avalonstar.com.

    If interested in selling please reply at your earliest convenience.
    Also let me know the asking price or we can just submit an offer.
    Either way works.

    Thanks for your time,

    Mike B [name hidden to protect the... hahaha... innocent.]

What should I ask for, a few million?
