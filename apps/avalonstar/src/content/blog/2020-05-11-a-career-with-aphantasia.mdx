description: How my journey of self-discovery led to a startling realization
  about the way my mind works—and how it shaped my entire career as a designer.

Since going to see a [life coach](http://www.drsaum.com/) in 2013, the years that followed have been ones of intense self-learning, discovery, and recovery. Essentially, I started applying the problem-solving skills I had developed as a student of the design industry to myself, which was… extremely difficult. But being on this road made a video I found in 2018—and what I eventually pieced together from it—all the more earth-shattering.

**I have aphantasia.**  
As I watched this video, my processes, my mannerisms, the way I'd handle myself in disagreements—the **why** of all of it suddenly started to make sense. I always thought the whole "picture yourself on a desert island" was a metaphor, not something somebody could _actually_ do.

## The "Re-Designer"

"My name is Bryan Veloso, and I am a **re-designer**. I do not create, I improve. I do not envision what is new, I envision how something that already exists can be better."

This was the opening to a [post I wrote in 2010](https://avalonstar.com/blog/2010/the-re-designer/).  
Being a re-designer was a strong part of my personal brand and what people came to know me for.

I thought back to my 12 years working professionally in the industry: every position I've held, every website I've made, and every statement I've made about myself as a web designer. I had a career that I was proud of, but I changed the question from _"how was I able to do all this?"_ to _"how did my aphantasia direct the way I chose to design?"_

A much better question.

My specialization in design came from a library of techniques and inspirational imagery. Techniques were about knowing _how_ to ask the right question or approach the right resource, while inspirational imagery depended on the project. Early in my career, sites like the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) gave me insight into design possibilities, shaping my ability to improve existing concepts rather than create from scratch.

If you're a designer—or in any creative field—dealing with similar challenges, my journey with aphantasia has shown me that embracing what makes you different can lead to valuable insights and innovation.
