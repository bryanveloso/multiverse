# Summary

Facebook's first set of business cards as a small Palo Alto startup were created in late 2005, when the company had less than 100 employees. Each card was designed with a look matching Facebook's website design at the time, as well as a custom tagline selected by each employee. Mark Zuckerberg's card, bearing the phrase "I'm CEO... bitch," was particularly infamous.

# Involvement

I designed it.

What started as a memorable phrase said to me as a meme in one-on-one meetings found its way on a business card, and then somehow out of the lips of Justin Timberlake in The Social Network.
