In the over half-a-decade I've spent switching from a mentality of "designing and selling a _product_" versus "designing and selling _yourself_," one of the single biggest hurdles I've faced is my own anxiety.

I could probably write countless pages on the battles I've waged against my own anxiety since I started that war years ago. Honestly, given that I'm trying to find my footing with this type of content creation again, I may have the opportunity to do so. But rather than have this be a monolithic post about that war, I want to focus on something that has helped me at least win a couple of battles.

## The Idea of Subscriber Streams

Last year, [Twitch introduced the concept of Subscriber Streams](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/06/26/superfans-welcome-subscriber-streams-are-coming-to-twitch-fc90cab23a73/). Up until then, one could only ever restrict the ability to chat or to view past broadcasts to their paying (or [Twitch Prime](https://twitch.amazon.com/tp)) viewers.

## Lessons Learned

Subscriber streams allowed me to:

- Play games I was excited about in a more comfortable and intimate setting.
- Avoid random spoilers or interruptions, reducing the burden on moderators.
- Remove the constant pressure to market myself and my content.

Ultimately, these streams created a space where I felt _valid_ and _safe_â€”a crucial step for anyone struggling with similar challenges.

## Final Thoughts

If you're battling similar struggles, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. However, prioritizing your comfort when creating content is always worth the effort. Streaming should be an enjoyable, fulfilling experience for both you and your community.

You deserve to feel that way too.
