A list of things I still need to do for Avalonstar.

- [ ] Create a video embed component.
- [ ] Create a blockquote component.
- [ ] Create a component for displaying inline "tweets".
- [ ] Change `heroImage` into an object with `src` and `<caption>` properties.
- [ ] Do further research on view transitions: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/
