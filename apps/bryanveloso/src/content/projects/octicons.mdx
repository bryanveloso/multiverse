summary: 'Octicons are a set of icons that serve as the foundation of a consistent visual language across projects at GitHub. Originally envisioned as an icon font, they&apos;ve since evolved to become a set of SVGs that are made available to the public in numerous ways.'
involvement: 'I spearheaded the project with the creation of icon concepts based on the terms used on the site: _repositories and pull requests_ being two examples, and worked with the rest of the team to draw a couple of them.'
