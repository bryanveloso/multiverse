title: "Absorbed By Live Streaming"

description: "Working for Twitch introduced me to an entirely new world, and an new passion: live streaming. I was hooked, and after my own push for Twitch Partnership, Avalonstar became more of a self-identifier than the blog it represented for 15 years. It wouldn't be until the 20th anniversary of avalonstar.com that I would start dusting off the cobwebs."
