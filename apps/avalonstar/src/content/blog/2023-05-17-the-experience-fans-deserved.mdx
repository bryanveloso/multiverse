If you had approached me 15 years ago and told me I would have the opportunity to conceptualize and design a convention booth for a group of idols, I would have thought that there was absolutely no way. For the majority of my career, except in [a few choice occasions](), the fandom that my now-wife introduced me to in 2005 was mutually exclusive to the rest of me.

My time at [VShojo](https://vshojo.com) as head of design and product changed all of that. VShojo, for those unfamiliar with the concept, is a talent agency that focuses on promoting [VTuber content creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber). The concept of VTubing is an entirely separate rabbit hole in and of itself. That said, itâ€™s worth the journey if ever you find yourself in need of a good rabbit hole. 

Back to the booth. VShojo has never been short of innovative ideas, and when compared to their competition, have always pushed the envelope when it came to connecting talent and fans. From iPads on Segways to  technology that allowed talent to sign posters from the comfort of their home. So when the opportunity arose to upgrade [their TwitchCon 2022 booth experience](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/vtuber-twitchcon-meet-and-greet-vshojo-projekt-melody-rcna51794) for Anime Expo 2023, I leapt at the chance.
