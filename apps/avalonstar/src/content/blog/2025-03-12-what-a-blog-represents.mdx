# What a Blog Represents

[self: do I write about the timeline in this? @_@]

...

This domain turns 25-years-old this year. The act of blogging has changed a lot over that same amount of time. At least for me, the advent of microblogging dampened and then outright killed my willingness to write longer-form content. And if I did want to write something longer? I’d make a thread. I did all this knowing that avalonstar.com sat here collecting dust, waiting for an opportunity to house my thoughts like it had done for more than a decade.

[write about changes in me]

## The Nostalgia Bug

I have a tendency of developing “theses” about things that would probably fail in a doctoral setting. I also don’t write them down for that same reason, but I devote a lot of brain time to them all the same. My longest running thesis is: “The Substantial Effect of Social Politics in Silicon Valley.” Maybe I’ll actually elaborate on that in text someday, but... baby steps. I digress.

The entire revival of avalonstar.com in _this_ particular style is a direct result of what a personal site that is a quarter-century old should represent. To be fair, this a “first-world problem” in a way that not a lot of people even have personal sites that are as old or have as much affinity for as I do with this place. Some see blogging as simply a way to exhale their thoughts onto a screen, or to provide value through spreading knowledge. There is no existential step above that. It serves its utility, and if you picked a stable hosting provider, it would stand the test of time as a place that housed your thoughts. But it’d be one of many. 

But what if we did zoom out a bit more? [If you were fortunate enough](https://snook.ca) or determined enough to gather all of your thoughts in one place, and then you zoomed out: **what does that represent?** 

It’s a chronicle of your life.
