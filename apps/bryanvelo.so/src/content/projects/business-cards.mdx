title: 'Business Cards'
company: 'Facebook'
date: '2005-12'
summary: "Facebook's first set of business cards as a small Palo Alto startup were created in late 2005, when the company had less than 100 employees. Each card was designed with a look matching Facebook's website design at the time, as well as a custom tagline selected by each employee. Mark Zuckerberg's card, bearing the phrase “I'm CEO... bitch,” was particularly infamous."

What started as a memorable phrase said to me as a meme in one-on-one meetings found its way on a business card, and then somehow out of the lips of Justin Timberlake in [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/).'
