As a "Super Hybrid Robot" at GitHub (a role that combined design, development, and community engagement), I worked on various aspects of GitHub's web interface during a period of significant growth for the platform.

## Key Contributions

- Redesigned core user interfaces to improve developer workflow and experience
- Created and maintained design systems for consistent application across GitHub's products
- Collaborated with engineering teams to implement designs in production
- Engaged with the community to gather feedback and iterate on design solutions
- Helped establish GitHub's distinctive visual identity and design language

## Impact

My work at GitHub helped shape how developers interact with the platform daily, emphasizing usability without sacrificing functionality. The design systems I contributed to allowed GitHub to scale its visual language consistently as the product grew.
