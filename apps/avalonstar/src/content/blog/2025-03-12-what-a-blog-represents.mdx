This domain turns 25-years-old this year.

The act of blogging has changed a lot over that same amount of time. At least for me, the advent of microblogging dampened and then outright killed my willingness to write longer-form content. And if I did want to write something longer, I’d make a thread... on the microblogging site. I did all this knowing that avalonstar.com sat here collecting dust, waiting for an opportunity to house my thoughts like it had done for more than a decade.

## The Nostalgia Bug

I tell my community, The Crusaders, that nostalgia is my weakness. If you’ve known me for any amount of time, walked into my [stream](https://twitch.tv/avalonstar), and presented me with a fond memory, you’d instantly derail me. It’s **super effective**, as they say. The fact is, I’ve always enjoyed personal, experiential nostalgia. I see it as the other side of the ambition coin. Ambition requires measurement of some kind. You have to know where you’ve been to not only know where you’re going, but know how far you traveled to get there.

The entire revival of avalonstar.com in _this_ particular style is a direct result of what a personal site this old should represent. 

To be fair, this is a “first-world problem” in a way that not a lot of people even have personal sites that are as old or have as much affinity for as I do with this place. Some see blogging as simply a way to exhale their thoughts onto a screen, or to provide value through spreading knowledge. There is no existential step above that. It serves its utility, and if you picked a stable hosting provider, it would stand the test of time as a place that housed your thoughts. 

But it’d be one of many such houses. Twitter, Reddit, even Discord and LinkedIn are places that can house pieces of you: their user experiences crafting what category of thought you’d leave there. Services like Medium with “baked-in” audiences and monetary support mechanisms fought to centralize long-form thought. There were times where I thought there were better places to post, or I had outgrown this place as a blog. No matter what the reasoning, the effect was that avalonstar.com kept getting shoved down the flow chart of “where do I post this thought”? 

## The Stratospheric View

Humor me for a bit and take that existential step with me. What if we did zoom out a bit more? [If you were fortunate enough](https://snook.ca) or determined enough to gather all of your thoughts in one place, and then you zoomed out: _what does that represent?_

**It’s a chronicle of your life.**

A blog that’s stood for upwards of quarter-century becomes more than just a series of posts. It’s a snapshot of who you were at the time you wrote it. (It’s not just blogs either, take a look an exported snapshot of 120-character posts: it’s a time capsule.) It’s fun, albeit a bit embarrassing sometimes, to travel back to old posts and remember what state of mind you were in, how far you’ve traveled, and honestly, how much freer we were breathing the fresh air of a younger Internet.

The thing about all of this though is that blogs and even micro posts lack context. They lack the context of how old you were, where you lived, what did for a living, all things that would have had an effect on your state of mind. All of these things can be determined, but it takes work. I’m willing to divulge this information because it exists to support the stories I tell. And it is here that I circle back to the title of this post, **what this blog represents.**
