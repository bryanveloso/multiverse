  the latest evolution of my little corner of the web.

Lots of people will see the phrase "May 1st Reboot" and not know what it means. To paraphrase, the reboot [was a yearly event](https://youtube.com/watch?v=giG48VZlMdk) (that skipped a few years here and there) that gave designers a chance to participate in a global renewal of the creative web by simultaneously shutting down and relaunching their sites over the course of a month. My first "reboot" was in 2004, and it became a great source of motivation to give Avalonstar a facelift.

I figure, "reboot" is the best way to title this post, given the date. That said, it's funny that I'm writing this on May 1st. Equally humorous is the fact that I've rebooted with a site that isn't 100% complete. I guess some things never change! **Technically**, Avalonstar changed on March 1st, albeit also in an unfinished state.

But let's back up a bit.

## A Chance to Change

If you've known me for any length of time, you know that I am a big fan of **nostalgia**. In a life in which I hold myself to unreasonable expectations, seeing how far I've come from a given point in time always manages to put a smile on my face. That was no different for 2020, or what would be this domain's _20th_ year. I had contracted an amazing designer to help me reimagine Avalonstar's brand in 2019, but avalonstar.com stayed _stubbornly_ dormant. The last entry I had written here was three weeks into my tenure at Twitch in 2014, along with a couple of entries thrown on Medium.

## Avalonstar in 2020

The last version of this site was built in [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a Ruby-based static site generator. Over the years, I’ve transitioned from Python to Node, experimented with frameworks like [Ember](https://emberjs.com/), and currently create [Twitch overlays](https://github.com/avalonstar/synthavln) in [React](https://reactjs.org/). Returning to Avalonstar, I wanted to use tools I was comfortable with and settled on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I explored headless CMS solutions and initially used [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), but later switched to [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/). Sanity’s model-based schema felt familiar and offered a great full-screen writing experience.
