Avalonstar TV was my personal streaming brand on Twitch, where I combined my passion for design with livestreaming technology to create a unique viewing experience.

## Project Overview

I created a custom streaming interface that included:

- Animated overlay system with dynamic scene transitions
- Real-time event notifications for followers, subscribers, and donations
- Custom-designed components that reflected my personal brand
- Interactive elements that responded to stream events
- Integration with Twitch's API for real-time data

## Technical Implementation

The overlay system was built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) with WebSocket connections to various streaming services for real-time updates. This allowed for seamless integration with OBS and other broadcasting software while maintaining a unique visual style.

## Impact

The Avalonstar TV design system became recognized in the streaming community and influenced other creators' approach to broadcast design. The project demonstrated how web technologies could be used to create distinctive streaming experiences beyond standard templates.
